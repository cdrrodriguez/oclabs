                      There are different types of blockchain and differents ways to use them.
                     Some are public, others private. 

                     Some have a cost to use them, others do not have a direct cost. 
                     Using a blockchain is not just using bitcoin or smart contract implementation, 
                     it has to do with thinking about how its benefits and how can help in business.
                      Companies need to understand how to use blockchain for their business 
                      processes, and how a decentralization generate benefits and not 
                      problems.

                      What we do is detect the pain points in those business processes and 
                      expose how blockchain could improvement them, obtaining more efficiency 
                      and  a reduction of costs.
                  

                        We have a consulting team integrated by experts on different types 
                        of blockchain, to advise our clients on how to make better 
                        use of this technology.

          Blockchain technology enables distributed public ledgers that hold immutable data in a secure and encrypted way and ensure that transactions can never be altered. While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are the most popular examples of blockchain usage, this “distributed ledger technology” (DLT) is finding a broad range of uses. Data storage, financial transactions, real estate, asset management and many more uses are being explored.
